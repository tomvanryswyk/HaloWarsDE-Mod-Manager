# HaloWarsDE Mod Manager
Forked to test adding extended functionality.  For example, disable flying units if you're looking for a ground war.

Picturing a bunch of toggles for various units and features (i.e. infinite resources).  Maybe through a popup window or side menu?

Do not use this code under any circumstances.  It's my sandbox for now.
